# EZ-Controller-Driver-Selector

This code was made ~2 years ago and was never published, so here it is!  This is for some pros 3 version so it would probably need updating to work correctly on pros 4.  

## What is it?
Do you have a team with multiple people who want to drive but you can't agree on control schemes?  Driver A wants their intake button to be L2 and driver B wants their intake button to be L1?  This repository is an attempt to solve this problem.  

This gives you "driver profiles" that you can select between, and modify, live through the controller window.  To save anything you'd have to modify the source code.  

To make this a real library this would probably need a complete overhaul and I'm not interested in that right now.  It's pretty cumbersome to setup but it got the job done once it's all setup.
